OpenCV
======
This is a bash script for installing OpenCV 2.7 or + in linux. Before running the script **save your extracted** OpenCV tarball in **~/Documents/opencvsource**. Just run the script as 

`sudo bash installation.sh`
I have recently put up a support for python also. I needed it.
Thats it ! . Any suggestions are welcome.
